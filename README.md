# Software_Project-Python-Code

I took my inspiration for the great artist Sol le Witt
i created a peice of art by drawing lines going four different directions
The way that i acheived that was by doin the same thing over and over again but simply editing the code very slightly and evrynow and then add another line of code
As i was working on this project i didnt know what i wanted to but then Roman showed us the art from Sol le Witt and then i relized what i wanted to do for my art. 
the process of actually doingn the project was very simple but tiring
